fix: "$RE &nosub"

note: |
  Regexp captures come with overhead, and if the groups are not needed one can
  avoid that overhead by setting the field '&nosub'.

  This lint misses uses of the capture groups in hooks not defined at the
  field. If you are sure the capture group is used in a such a hook you can
  suppress this lint by adding '// ast-grep-ignore: regexp-capture' above the
  line triggering the lint.
